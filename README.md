This work group comprises three tasks, each with distinct inputs. Tasks one and two are located in the `arrayManipulation.js` file, while task three is found in the `userInfo.js` file. Below is an illustration of these tasks:

### Task 1: Array Manipulation

In this task, you will create JavaScript functions to manipulate arrays and change strings based on related numbers. Specifically, the Array Manipulation project involves:

- Processing arrays of integers.
- Modifying associated arrays of strings according to predefined rules.

### Task 2: Format Array Strings

Using the `formatArrayStrings` function, you can format strings with the help of array manipulation. This function takes two arrays as input:

- An array of strings.
- A numerical array processed by the `processArray` function.

The function then modifies each string based on its corresponding number as follows:

- Converts the entire string to uppercase if the number is even.
- Converts the string to lowercase if the number is odd.

### Task 3: Create Array of Objects

In this task, you take an array of names and the array of modified names from Task 2. The task involves returning an array of objects, each containing the following properties:

- `originalName`
- `modifiedName`
- `id`
